# vim_setup

## NVIM
the `nvim` folder is to be placed under `~/.config` for the nvim setup. My neovim version is v0.7.2

To install all the plugins, you need to install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

## Tmux
`tmux.conf` is specific to [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) if you want any vim mapping in tmux, it also requires you to install [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) for some of the plugins.
